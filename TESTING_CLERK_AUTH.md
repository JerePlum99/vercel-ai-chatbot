# Testing Clerk Authentication Implementation

## Test Steps

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000/login
   - Verify the login page loads with the Google auth button
   - The UI should look identical to the previous version

3. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/auth-test
   - If not logged in, you should see a 401 Unauthorized response:
     ```json
     {
       "authenticated": false,
       "message": "Not authenticated"
     }
     ```

4. Return to the login page and click "Continue with Google"
   - You should be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
   - After authorizing, you should be redirected to the callback URL
   - Finally, you should be redirected to the homepage

5. Now visit http://localhost:3000/api/auth-test again
   - You should now see your authentication information:
     ```json
     {
       "authenticated": true,
       "userId": "your-clerk-user-id",
       "sessionId": "your-clerk-session-id"
     }
     ```

6. Test the sign-out functionality
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right
   - Click "Sign out"
   - You should be redirected to the login page
   - Visiting http://localhost:3000/api/auth-test should show unauthorized

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify your Clerk API keys are set correctly in .env.local
3. Make sure Google OAuth is configured properly in the Clerk Dashboard
4. Check the server logs for any authentication-related errors
5. Verify that the middleware is correctly set up and running

## Next Steps

Once basic authentication is working:

1. Test the dev impersonation feature if you're in development mode
2. Implement the user data migration plan
3. Update any remaining components that use the user object
4. Consider implementing additional Clerk features like user profiles

# Clerk Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating authentication from NextAuth to Clerk.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Updated database schema to work with Clerk
- ✅ Created Clerk webhook handler for user synchronization
- ✅ Set up Clerk middleware
- ✅ Created sign-in and sign-up pages
- ✅ Updated app components to use Clerk authentication
- ✅ Created helper functions for user management

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Set Up Clerk in Dashboard**
   - Create a Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard
   - Configure Google OAuth provider with your client ID/secret
   - Set up webhooks to point to `/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - Add JWT templates with external ID support if needed

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Add Clerk API keys to `.env.local` following the example file
   - Set up webhook secret from the Clerk Dashboard

3. **Database Migration**
   - Run the database migration to update the schema
   - Consider testing on a database copy first

4. **User Data Migration (Optional)**
   - If needed, export existing users from your database
   - Import them to Clerk using the migration script
   - Set external IDs in Clerk to maintain database relationships

5. **Testing**
   - Test the complete authentication flow
   - Verify that existing users can still access their data
   - Test webhook functionality for user synchronization

## Production Deployment Checklist

1. Set up a Clerk production instance
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Update database in production
4. Deploy the application
5. Monitor authentication and user access

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. Keep NextAuth code and routes commented but available
2. Revert middleware to NextAuth
3. Restore original user table schema
4. Deploy these changes as a rollback
